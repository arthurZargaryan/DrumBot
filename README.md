# DrumBot
This project was spilt over two major parts, the first of which required us to get acquainted with the motor controller, Arduino and linear actuators and develop a predefined beat using simple programming. The second part of the course we linked a human input device with the drum, in this situation a sonar sensor was employed. The drum therefore beat at a frequency proportional to the distance of the hand from the sensor.
